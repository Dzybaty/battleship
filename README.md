If you need to run the app in debug mode (allows using Redux-Dev-Tools), use `yarn dev`.

## Rules and Game Process

### Basic Rules
The goal of Battleship is to sink all opponent's ships before they sink all of your ships.
You should make strikes by calling out the coordinates of one of the squares on the field.
The other player also tries to hit your ships by calling out coordinates.
Neither you nor the other player can see each other's field so you must try to guess where they are.

### Game Process
The game consists of two main phases: _Preparation Phase_ and _Game phase_.

#### Preparation Phase
Each player places the 5 ships somewhere on their [Field](#Fields).

During this phase player should place all his ships on the field by dragging
each ship from his [Fleet](#Fleet);

Ship names, sizes and count:

|       Name        |  Size   |Count|
| ----------------- | ------: |---: |
| Aircraft Carrier  |    5    | 1   |
| Battleship        |    4    | 1   |
| Cruiser           |    4    | 1   |
| Destroyer         |    2    | 2   |
| Submarine         |    1    | 2   |

Basic placement rules:
- All ship must be placed inside the field
- Ships may not overlap each other
- No ships can be placed on another ship
- A minimum space between ships is one cell

After first player has placed all his ships, a [Prompt](#Next Turn Prompt) will appear.
The prompt serves two purposes:
- Prevent a player from revealing another player's board.
- Give the next player some tim to prepare for his turn.

When the second player has finished his placement, the next phase starts.

#### Game Phase
During this phase each player have two boards: 
- their own [Field](#Fields) (left one) which shows his placement and enemy hits.
- enemy [Field](#Fields) (right one) which does not show enemy ship placement and is used for making strikes.

Each turn player should click any cell on the enemy [Field](#Fields) trying to hit opponents ship.
Every successful hit will be marked on the enemy field with `X` symbol. After successful hit, player can
make another attempt until he misses.

If player misses his strike, the cell on the enemy field will be marked with `Â·` and a prompt will appear,
asking another player to prepare for his turn.

#### Game ending
The game ends, when one of players destroys all opponent ships (19 cells). After the last successful hit,
a [Window](#Game Results) with game results will appear. Anew game can be started here.
